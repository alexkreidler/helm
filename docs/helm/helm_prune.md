## helm prune

Purges deleted releases

### Synopsis


This command purges all deleted releases, cleaning them from removing them permanently so they can't be rolled back.
Internally, it performs the 'helm list --deleted' command to find all releases with the stats 'Status_DELETED',
and then runs the 'helm delete --purge' command on those releases.

The prune command is designed to encourage a workflow of not immediately purging releases.
This gives users the opportunity to 'rollback' a delete if necessary, and then 'prune' their releases
when they are sure that they are not necessary anymore.
